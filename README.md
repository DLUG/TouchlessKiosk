Touchless Kiosk System
============

Normaly, Kiosk has small screen and touch interface.

My team makes kiosk with big screen. Big screen has some advantage. you can read small text more comfortable and you can experience path that you want to go. Shortly, you can get information more effectively and directly.

But with big screen, Touch interface is not comfortably. so my team apply voice recognition and gesture recognition.

If you stand in front of Kiosk, Kiosk will show first page and ask you about your need. If kiosk has information you want, Kiosk will show about it. If kiosk don't understand your voice or don't have information you want, kiosk will show menu and you just point menu you want with your finger to select menu.
