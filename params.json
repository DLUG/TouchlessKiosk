Big screen has some advantage. you can read small text more comfortable and you can experience path that you want to go. Shortly, you can get information more effectively and directly.\r\n\r\nBut with big screen, Touch interface is not comfortably. so my team apply voice recognition and gesture recognition.\r\n\r\nIf you stand in front of Kiosk, Kiosk will show first page and ask you about your need. If kiosk has information you want, Kiosk will show about it. If kiosk don't understand your voice or don't have information you want, kiosk will show menu and you just point menu you want with your finger to select menu.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrototype Video : http://youtu.be/zZtGsasfYDs\r\n\r\nFinal work Video : http://youtu.be/EhjqFlLbHu8\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt contains two Eclipse Projects.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nDankook Linux User Group\r\nhttp://www.dlug.org\r\nhttp://facebook.com/dlug.page","name":"Touchless kiosk System","google":"","tagline":"OpenCV based Kiosk"}
